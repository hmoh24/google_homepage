This project is the first coding project assigned by theodinproject. I will attempt to use the CSS and HTML knowledge learned so far to recreate the google homepage and search page.

*Skills Learnt and displayed*

This has allowed me to further my understanding of positioning elements and the techniques to use, primarily flexbox and grid. In general, I am more aware of how flexbox is used for one dimensional alignment, and grid is a solution for two dimensions and thus I am more confident with CSS as a whole. My knowledge of styling has increase, too.

Apart from positioning problems, one problem I ran into included the two buttons under the main search input moving when I applied a border to the hover status. The solution, I learnt, is to implement a box shadow.

I have also become more comfortable with using git from the linux command line.
