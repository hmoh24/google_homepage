This project is the first coding project assigned by theodinproject. I will attempt to use the CSS and HTML knowledge learned so far to recreate the google homepage and search page. The google homepage is the 'easy' version, and the search page the 'hard' version.

*Skills Learnt and displayed*

This has allowed me to further my understanding of positioning elements and the techniques to use, primarily flexbox and grid. In general, I am more aware of how flexbox is used for one dimensional alignment, and grid is a solution for two dimensions and thus I am more confident with CSS as a whole. My knowledge of styling has increased considerably, too.

Apart from positioning problems, one problem I ran into included the two buttons under the main search input moving when I applied a border to the hover status. The solution, I learnt, is to implement a box shadow rather than an outline on hover.

I have also become more comfortable with using git from the linux command line.

I made these pages from scratch, only looking at the websites for guidance. I used and increased familiarity with chrome dev tools. It allowed me to make the finishing troubleshooting considerably easier, as chrome had some native rules that were not present in mozilla firefox, which was the original testing browser.

Some features are missing from the search page. I am keen to move onto javascript, so I have chosen to omit them as the skills gained from implementing features I know how to implement is not worth the time cost.
